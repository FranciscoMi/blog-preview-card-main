## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What we have learned

- Usar la funciÃ³n clamp() en css para escalar los elementos de la web

clamp() en css nos permite establecer un rango de valores posibles a un elemento HTML. La sintÃ¡xis es la siguiente:
```css
property: clamp(min, ideal, max);
```

- Trabajar con unidades de medida en CSS (Diferencias entre <b>em</b> y <b>rem</b>)

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
